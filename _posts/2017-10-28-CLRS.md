title: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms
---


A programmer or any developer ought to have a deep concept in *Data Structures and Algorithms*. First, one should be confident with the opted language (I would recommend Python) spend time on basic Data Structures and Algorithms.

* The book which I'm gonna study is [*Introduction to Algorithms*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5ykl6rfifk6vdbd/Introduction.to.Algorithms.pdf?dl=0) also known as CLRS.
* Also the Design and Analysis of Algorithms on *Coursera* by Stanford University.
* *NPTEL* course on the same by IIT Delhi is also good.

###Practising Programming

If you love solving puzzles, then competetitive programming is for you and also for preparing for ACM ICPC.
