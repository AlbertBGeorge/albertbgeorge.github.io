<p>Hi everyone!
Hey guys, this is Albert!
 
As you probably might have guessed by now, this is my very first blog hosted on the Github pages using Jekyll. The modulus operandi of this is to post my updates and current projects. This is created for personal blogging, but anyone can follow I don't mind at all.

The idea of making a blog struck to me while watching a course on Networking and I realised I need a platform of my own to voice my work on the internet. And tah-dah! Here comes my blog.
Now straight to the point, I might not find enough time to keep this blog up-to-date, but I'll try my best.

Do follow my works on Github
Peace out!</p>
