title: Goals for the second semester!
---

So the first sem just ended followed by a small break. The next sem began from the first day of this year. Excited and motivated, let's see where this goes. The following accomplishments are on my bucket list for now:

* Using Databases with Python
* Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python
* Data Structures and Algorithms from IIT D
* DS and A implementation using Python by CMI
* Calculus in One real variable or Linear Algebra

Found an interest in ML and excited for the same. I'll (try to) keep an accomplishment journal from this year, some passive reading, and try to burn some fat. Last year taught me crypo day trading is not my cup of tea, and importancing of hodling to one we believe.
