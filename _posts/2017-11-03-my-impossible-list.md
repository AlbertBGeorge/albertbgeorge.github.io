title: My Impossible List
---
<p>
I had an old bucket list, which had some random nearly impossible events without any defined time, I thought that won't help me to take action now.
To fix that, I'm creating a new list which I call it my **impossible list**. I got this idea while going through a Youtube video by [*Thomas Frank*](https://www.youtube.com/user/electrickeye91) who explained the difference. 
Put together, this is an ever-increasing list of experiences that build upon each other, and more importantly implore me to take action. This page is very personal, but I won't mind anyone having a look at it.

### Current Focuses:

*03/11/2017*
Right now, my main focus is to prioritize on getting good grades in the first semester, and kickstart a fresh begining to the next.
Learning programming, and self improving, and getting fit by maintaining a strict diet and burning a lot of fat.

The rest of my current priorities will be posted in a separate post.

I'd like to sum up the list following a quote:

*“A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.” – Robert Heinlein"*


If you found this list inspiring, I'd challenge you to create one on your own.
