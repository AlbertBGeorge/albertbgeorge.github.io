title: Let the hacking begin!
---

<p>So guys, this post marks a new begining. Aaanndd, I need an OS project to start with, Since I have zero hands on knowledge with real-life projects, I need to pick a simple one, I'm on the process of choosing one to make my contributions (Guys, if you can suggest me anything, feel free to tweet me!)<br>
Meanwhile, I'm doing a course on <i>Calculus of One Real Variable</i> which might come in handy in programming ahead, and also some extra credits. So, need to devote about 7 hours a week for that.
<br><br>
And, there's something call FOSSMEC at our college, I need to solve their alogorithmic problems to start with on HackerRank.com and push it on their repository.
Only 4 days of holidays left, I need to fire up now.
<br>
Btw, did I tell you that Onam was a blast! (kinda)</p>
