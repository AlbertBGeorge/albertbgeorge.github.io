title: Moving forward in Python
---

<p>
Last two days were kinda okayish, didn't do as I planned, to study math and engineering graphics (Lol). But nvm, I spent time learning XML parsing on Coursera using Python, completed this weeks assignments.<br>
Alas, I'm three weeks late at the Calculus in One variable course, I hope I can catch it up (positively) since I need to write their exam and pass to get the certificate.<br>
And MECMUN is on the way, have to squeze in time for that too. I gave in my application to represent Japan in SPECPOL. (I'll keep you updated.<br>
And I ordered a new phone, thanks dad! ;)<br>
Tomorrow is the day decicated to studying Engg Graphics, hope I don't flunk in the series test. ANd rest of the time will be utilised to watch Death Note, i'm on episode 20 (yay!) and it's pretty brilliant stuff.</p>
