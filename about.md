## Just Who The Heck Are You, Dude?


My name is Albert B George. I'm a fresher in Computer Science Major at Govt. Model Engineering College, Thrikkakara. My passion lies in developing things and learning. I started this blog in Sept, 2017 as a benchmark to keep a personal journal.

I'm a massive geek, and IMHO, a hoopy frood who knows where his towel is. I love comics, anime, video games, TV series, and books. I'm also addicted to travelling.
